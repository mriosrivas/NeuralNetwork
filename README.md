# NeuralNetwork
This repository contains two main parts:
1. An integer implementation of training/inference of a neural network using python.
2. A SystemVerilog implementation of the integer neural network targeted for an FPGA.

Basic requirements to run the implementation are:
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
